Introduction: <br/>
A few weeks ago, I watched the UEFA Champions League Group Stage Draw, and for the first time, the draw was conducted using a computer. While watching, I couldn't help but wonder: How was it done? What algorithm was behind it?

After some research and development, I found the answers. Today, I'm excited to present a full simulation of the UEFA Champions League Group Stage Draw. With this project, you can now host your very own draw!

How It Works:  <br/>
This simulation mimics the UEFA Champions League draw process. Each pot consists of a group of teams based on their rankings and performance. The draw process involves randomly selecting clubs from each pot and pairing them to form the matches. The simulation ensures that the clubs are matched according to the real-world rules, such as avoiding clashes between teams from the same country.

Click "Start Draw" to begin the simulation and see how the teams are matched!

Features:  <br/>
Simulate the Champions League group stage draw with full automation. <br/>
View and manage matches between teams from different pots. <br/>
Host your own draw with customizable settings. <br/>

Limitations:  <br/>
Due to the rules of the draw, there may be situations where a club cannot be paired with an opponent because all valid options have already been chosen. <br/>
This limitation is inherent to the draw rules and cannot be resolved through the current algorithm. <br/>
If you encounter this issue, please restart the draw by refreshing the page. <br/>
